## Description
+ This is a blog system powered by Express.js and React.
+ Demonstrations
    + [My blog](https://iamazing.cn/) (may not be the latest version).
    + [Heroku App](https://express-react-blog.herokuapp.com/) (visit the [management system](https://express-react-blog.herokuapp.com/admin/) with default username `admin` and password `123456`)

## Highlights
1. You can use a **code editor** to edit your content (built-in ACE code editor with multiple themes), f**k WYSIWYG editor.
2. Easy to configure and integrate with disqus and statistics system.
3. You can copy from OneNote or any other programs and **paste your content with formatting** (with the `paste with formatting` feature, don't forget to set the page type to `raw`).
4. You can use this to deploy your single page web application (such as a [game](https://iamazing.cn/page/online-battle-city)), just paste the code and set the page type to `raw`.
5. System deploy is extremely simple, no need to configure the database (here I use SQLite as the default database, but it's easy to move to other database, just by modifying the `knexfile.js`).
